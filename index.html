								<h5>What I Hope to Learn</h5>
								<p>I hope to get better at natively impelementing responsive navigations without the use of a framework like <em>Bootstrap</em> or <em>Foundation</em>.  I'd like to implement subtle animations using only CSS3 that can gracefully degrade onto devices that do not support them, which isn't much aside from old versions of IE.</p>
								<h5>How This Relates to What I've Learned Throughout My Degree</h5>
								<p>This is very important to UI design and development, because it is the main area that a user can use to find their way around your website or application.  Without a good navigation, users may find themselves lost, not finding what they need from you, or going to a competitor when they give up on your service.</p>

								<h4>2. Hero Slideshow</h4>
								<div class="image-grid clear">

								</div>
								<h5>What I Hope to Learn</h5>
								<p>I'd like to learn how to implement a purely CSS3 slideshow with full animations and transitions.</p>
								<h5>How This Relates to What I've Learned Throughout My Degree</h5>
								<p>I think it is important to learn to do this because implementing a responsive slideshow, with little or no use of javascript plugins is a useful skill to have.  I think it will improve my transition and animation skills as well.</p>

								<h4>3. Layout Card Portfolio</h4>
								<div class="image-grid clear">
									<img src="img/components/layout-cards/01.jpg">
								</div>
								<h5>What I Hope to Learn</h5>
								<p>I would like to learn how to implement a grid of portfolio images that have randomly generated sizes, and on mouseover, expand to show an excerpt or tags, or some other information, along with a read more button to go to the page for that item.</p>
								<h5>How This Relates to What I've Learned Throughout My Degree</h5>
								<p>It's great to know how to effectively implement an online portfolio that can wow potential employees.  Sometimes, learning a new way to do it, or giving yourself a hard task can be great for the end presentation.</p>

								<h4>4. Custom Google Map</h4>
								<div class="image-grid clear">
									<img src="img/components/google-map/01.jpg">
								</div>
								<h5>What I Hope to Learn</h5>
								<p>I'd like to implement a customized google map onto a page and possibly give it some custom styling through the Google Maps API with JSON.</p>
								<h5>How This Relates to What I've Learned Throughout My Degree</h5>
								<p>A lot of people use Google Maps nowadays, especially on their websites.  If this can be implemented along side the brand, with brand itegration, then that is definitely a huge plus in user experience for the user and business.</p>

								<h4>5. Page Preloading</h4>
								<div class="image-grid clear">
									<img src="img/components/preloader/01.jpg">
								</div>
								<h5>What I Hope to Learn</h5>
								<p>I'd personally like to implement more page preloading in my life and projects for pages that have a lot of content.  I think it's a good user experience to ease the user into content and keep them aware of what's going on.</p>
								<h5>How This Relates to What I've Learned Throughout My Degree</h5>
								<p>I think it would be good for me to know how to do this better because it's an important feature of user experience.  Loading progress feedback tells the user that they should wait because something important is happening.</p>
								<h5>How I Can Implement This</h5>
								<p>I can implement this on the homepage and portfolio galleries on my project.  I will probably end up using some type of jquery in order to accomplish this to a degree.</p>
