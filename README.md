# Summary:

Over the past 4 weeks, I have developed several components.  I developed a responsive navigation, a CSS3 only slideshow, a masonry portfolio gallery, a custom google map, and a CSS3 preloader. The most interesting thing that I learned in building these components is that they were not as hard as I thought they would be to build.  I learned a great deal about CSS animations, which was my primary personal goal of this course.

I think the thing that I wish was different the most is that I wish I would have laid out a design for my site first and foremost before jumping into development.  I think it shows that I did not design it first.  If I could correct one thing now, that would be it, but itâ€™s been too late in the game to go back and do that.  

I think overall, I have learned some valuable design and development skills to apply to future projects.  I learned that it is important to separate and modularize components of websites and apps for reuse.  It was also neat to do the Agile development process with the class because it also helps in work and life to be more organized and efficient.  Communicating regularly keeps this flow moving.
